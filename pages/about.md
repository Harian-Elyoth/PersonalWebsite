# About Me  

Hey there! I'm Elyoth Harian, a French software engineer with a deep passion for project management, learning, and making things run smoother. I love optimizing workflows, finding better ways to collaborate, and exploring how technology can make our lives easier.  

### My Journey So Far  

I graduated from **Polytech Sorbonne** with an engineering degree, and since then, my career has been quite an adventure. I worked at **SAGEMCOM** and **Thales**, where I got to tackle complex tech challenges and learn from some incredible people. On top of that, I had the chance to teach **IoT at Sorbonne University**, which was an amazing experience—I love sharing knowledge and helping others grow.  

But I’ve always had that itch to build something of my own. That’s why I started working on **ThinkStorm**, a collaborative platform designed to make teamwork more efficient and seamless. It’s still a work in progress, but I’m excited about what’s coming next!  

### A New Chapter in South Korea  

Recently, I decided to shake things up and move to **South Korea** with my wife. New culture, new opportunities, new challenges—it’s a wild ride, and I’m here for it! Adapting to life here has been an adventure in itself, and I plan to share my experiences along the way.  

### What You'll Find Here 

This blog is my space to talk about the things that drive me:  
🚀 **Project management** – Strategies, tools, and real-life experiences.  
💡 **Collaboration & productivity** – How to work smarter, not harder.  
🌍 **Life in South Korea** – The highs, the lows, and everything in between.  
🔧 **Tech & side projects** – Cool things I'm building and learning.  

I'd love to connect with like-minded people, exchange ideas, and learn from different perspectives. So, feel free to reach out—let's talk!  

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy the ride with me. 🚀
