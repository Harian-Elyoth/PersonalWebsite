## Project Overview
We reengineered a standard coffee machine into a smart brewing system controllable via web interface. Users can:
- Customize sugar levels (1-5 cubes) 
- Select cup size (S/M/L)
- Create/save custom recipes
- Schedule automatic brewing
- Monitor ingredient levels in real-time

## Technical Breakdown üõ†Ô∏è

### Hardware Architecture
- **Brain**: Raspberry Pi 3B+ (MQTT broker/server) + ESP32 (sensor/motor control)
- **Sensing Suite**:
  - VL53L0X time-of-flight sensors (ingredient level monitoring)
  - Capacitive proximity sensor (cup detection)
  - Water level sensor
- **Actuation System**:
  - NEMA 14 stepper motors with custom 3D-printed augers
  - L298N motor drivers
  - Grove Relay for 230V kettle control
- **Safety**: Red LEGO-enclosed high voltage compartment

### Software Stack
- **Web Interface** (Python/Flask):
  - Recipe database (SQLite)
  - Scheduled brewing system
  - Real-time machine status dashboard
- **MQTT Communication** (Mosquitto):
  - Website ‚Üî Raspberry Pi ‚Üî ESP32
  - JSON payloads for brewing parameters
- **Firmware** (C++/Arduino):
  - Sensor data acquisition
  - Motor control algorithms
  - Safety interlocks

## Development Challenges üßó
1. **High Voltage Handling**: Safely controlling 230V kettle with ESP32
2. **Material Flow**: Designing 3D-printed augers for consistent sugar/coffee dispensing
3. **Sensor Fusion**: Combining multiple sensing modalities for reliable operation
4. **Real-time Sync**: Ensuring <500ms latency between web request and machine start

## Lessons Learned üéì
- **Team Collaboration**: Coordinating between 4 developers across hardware/software
- **Iterative Design**: 7 versions of 3D-printed augers to prevent ingredient clumping
- **Safety First**: Implementing multiple failsafes for high-voltage components
- **User Experience**: Balancing technical complexity with intuitive web interface

## Team Insights üí°
>"Well the coffee wasn't that good, in fact there was too much sugar for not enough coffee, but it was a fun project to work on."
